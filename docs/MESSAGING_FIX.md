# Chat Messaging Fix

## Problem

The agentic system was processing queries correctly, but messages weren't appearing in the chat interface:

1. ❌ No intermediate progress messages (search, analysis, translation)
2. ❌ No final generated answer being displayed

## Root Causes

### 1. Return Type Mismatch
- **Issue**: `processQuery()` returned a `string`, but the hook expected an object with `{ success, steps, finalAnswer }`
- **Impact**: The hook couldn't properly handle the result

### 2. No Progress Callbacks
- **Issue**: The orchestrator only logged to console; it didn't emit progress callbacks
- **Impact**: No intermediate messages appeared in the chat

### 3. Generator Streaming Not Used
- **Issue**: The orchestrator called `generate()` which returns a placeholder, not the actual answer
- **Impact**: Final answer was empty or very short (21 characters)

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated `processQuery()` Return Type

**Before:**
```typescript
async processQuery(userQuery: string): Promise<string>
```

**After:**
```typescript
async processQuery(
  userQuery: string,
  progressCallback?: (step: StepCallback) => void
): Promise<{
  success: boolean;
  steps: Array<{ tool: string; result: unknown }>;
  finalAnswer: string;
}>
```

### 2. Added Progress Callbacks Throughout

The orchestrator now emits progress callbacks at key points:

- ✅ **Agent Start**: "Starting query processing..."
- ✅ **RigVeda Check**: "Query is about RigVeda - proceeding with search"
- ✅ **Search**: "Searching iteration X/5..."
- ✅ **Search Complete**: "Found X verses" (with search results)
- ✅ **Analysis**: "Analyzing X verses..."
- ✅ **Analysis Complete**: "Analysis complete: X relevant verses found"
- ✅ **Translation**: "Translating X verses..."
- ✅ **Translation Complete**: "Translation complete: X verses translated"
- ✅ **Generation**: "Generating comprehensive answer..."
- ✅ **Complete**: "Query processing complete"
- ✅ **Errors**: Appropriate error messages

### 3. Fixed Generator to Use Streaming

**Before:**
```typescript
const generatorOutput = await this.callGenerator({...});
return generatorOutput.response; // Empty or placeholder
```

**After:**
```typescript
let finalAnswer = '';
for await (const chunk of this.generatorAgent.streamAnswer(
  userQuery,
  finalVerses,
  abortController.signal
)) {
  finalAnswer += chunk; // Collect full streamed response
}
return { success: true, steps, finalAnswer };
```

### 4. Updated Hook to Handle Progress

The hook now:
- ✅ Passes progress callback to `processQuery()`
- ✅ Handles all step types with appropriate messages
- ✅ Extracts search results from steps
- ✅ Displays final answer properly

## Progress Message Types

The system now emits these message types:

| Type | When Emitted | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `agent_start` | Query processing begins | "Starting query processing..." |
| `notification` | General status updates | "Query is about RigVeda..." |
| `search` | Before searching | "Searching iteration 1/5..." |
| `search_complete` | After search with results | "Found 5 verses" |
| `analysis` | Before analyzing | "Analyzing 5 verses..." |
| `analysis_complete` | After analysis | "Analysis complete: 3 relevant verses found" |
| `translation` | Before translating | "Translating 5 verses..." |
| `translation_complete` | After translation | "Translation complete: 5 verses translated" |
| `generation` | Before generating | "Generating comprehensive answer..." |
| `complete` | Query finished | "Query processing complete" |
| `error` | On errors | "Query is not about RigVeda" |

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `app/lib/agents/ai-sdk-orchestrator.ts`
   - Added progress callback parameter
   - Emit progress at every major step
   - Use generator's `streamAnswer()` method
   - Return proper result structure

2. ✅ `app/hooks/useAISDKAgent.ts`
   - Pass progress callback to `processQuery()`
   - Handle all step types
   - Extract search results properly
   - Display final answer correctly

## Result

Now the chat interface will show:

1. ✅ **Intermediate Progress**: Users see each step as it happens
   - "Searching iteration 1/5..."
   - "Found 5 verses"
   - "Analyzing 5 verses..."
   - "Translation complete: 5 verses translated"
   - etc.

2. ✅ **Final Answer**: The complete generated answer is displayed in the chat

3. ✅ **Search Results**: Verse search results are properly displayed with metadata

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Ask a question: "What is the Nasadiya Sukta about?"
2. You should see:
   - Progress messages throughout processing
   - Search result messages
   - Translation progress
   - Final comprehensive answer in the assistant's message bubble

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

Future improvements could include:

- **Streaming Display**: Show the answer as it's being generated (character by character)
- **Verse-Level Translation Progress**: Show "Translating verse 1/5..." for each verse
- **Interactive Search Results**: Allow users to click on verses in search results
- **Progress Bar**: Visual progress indicator for the overall query
