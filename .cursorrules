# Cursor AI Rules for RGFE Project

## Documentation

- **NEVER** create documentation files (*.md) in the project root directory
- **ALWAYS** create documentation files inside the `docs/` folder
- Documentation file types include: README files, guides, architecture docs, feature docs, implementation summaries, etc.
- Exception: The main `README.md` in the project root is allowed as it's the entry point for the repository

Examples:
- ✅ Good: `docs/SEARCH_FUNCTIONALITY.md`
- ✅ Good: `docs/EMBEDDING_SEARCH.md`
- ✅ Good: `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
- ❌ Bad: `SEARCH_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (in root)
- ❌ Bad: `EMBEDDING_SEARCH_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (in root)
- ❌ Bad: `LOGGING_AND_UI_CHANGES.md` (in root)

## File Organization

- Keep the project root clean and minimal
- Use appropriate subdirectories for all file types:
  - Documentation → `docs/`
  - Source code → `app/`
  - Configuration files → root (only when necessary)
  - Assets → `public/`

## Code Quality

- Follow TypeScript strict mode
- Fix all linter errors before completing tasks
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Prefer functional components in React

## Logging

- All agent interactions should be logged to console
- Use structured logging with clear separators
- Include request/response details for debugging
- Log search terms and results for transparency

## UI Guidelines

- Maintain minimal, clean interfaces
- Use consistent color schemes (currently grey tones)
- Avoid unnecessary icons and decorations unless explicitly requested
- Focus on content and usability
